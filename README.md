To add tasks to the to-do list, input the task name into the form and click the "Add" button. To check off a task on the list, simply click on the task name. To remove a task from the list, click on the corresponding "Delete" button. To use the beyond-basic functionality of moving tasks to the top or bottom of the list, click on the corresponding "Top" or "Bottom" buttons.

#Citations
I loosely followed an online tutorial located at https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp in building this to-do list, editing the code aesthetics and structure as I saw fit. Additionally, I also referenced https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_node_insertbefore.asp in building the additional feature of being able to rearrange the order of tasks in the to-do list.
