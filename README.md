I loosely followed an online tutorial located at https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp in building this to-do list, editing the code aesthetics and structure as I saw fit. Additionally, I also referenced https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_node_insertbefore.asp in building the additional feature of being able to rearrange the order of tasks in the to-do list.
